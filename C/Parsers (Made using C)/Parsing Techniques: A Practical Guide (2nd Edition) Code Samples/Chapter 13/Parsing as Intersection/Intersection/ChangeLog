	* grammar.h: the grammar data structure consists of four components:
	grammar, start_names[], nonterminals[], terminals[].  Of these,
	grammar and start_names[] are modified by the expansion process,
	but only grammar is copied, to 'its'. As a result, start_names was
	sometimes modified and thus damaged.  This has been kludged in
	print.c, but should be corrected.

	* read.c: a variable 'min_state' added, to avoid spurious 0 states.

	* grammar.h: changed the character type (in symbols, etc.) back to
	char.

2004-09-25    <Dick@ACER>

	* clean.c: removed the suppressing of printing undefined start
	symbols from print.c, and added a proper clean-up routine
	remove_undefined_roots() to clean.c.  See, however, the comment in
	grammar.h.

2004-09-24    <Dick@ACER>
	* grammar.h: changed the character type (in symbols, etc.) to
	explicit 'unsigned char'.

	* free.c: added a module free.[ch], to properly free memory.

	* clean.c: remove_unreachable_symbols(void) had a transitive
	closure in it around {mark_reachable_symbols();
	remove_unmarked_symbols();}, which is not necessary, on second
	thoughts. See comment at top of clean.c.

2004-09-12    Dick Grune (dick) at blade14.cs.vu.nl
	Added multiple start symbols, multiple start states, multiple FSAs.

2003-02-20    Dick Grune (dick) at blade14.cs.vu.nl
