This program generates sentences from any Context-Sensitive grammar, in
breadth-first fashion, until all possible sentences have been generated or
until interrupted (although it usually runs out of memory before that).

Unlike the name CSgen suggests, the program accepts all Type 0 grammars,
including those with empty left-hand sides and with start strings rather than
start symbols. This allows the program to be used as a recognizer: under the
-r option the grammar is reversed and "production" of the start string is
considered recognition.

Call is
	CSgen [-r[eversed]] [-s[teps]]
for production with the compiled-in grammar and start string. Sample grammars
are in gram?.c

The -s causes intermediate sentential forms to be printed, with number and
parent number. This allows the history of a production or reduction to be
retrieved.
