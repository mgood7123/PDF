<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Any [function declaration][Function declaration] or a getter/setter declaration in Kotlin may be marked <em>suspending</em> using the special <code>suspend</code> modifier. </span><span class="sentence">A function type for a particular value may also be marked suspending using the <code>suspend</code> modifier. </span><span class="sentence">Both normal functions and extension functions, top-level and member, anonymous and named, may be marked as suspending.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="TODO">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">TODO(<code>suspend val</code>?)</span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">A suspending function is different from normal functions by potentially having zero or more <em>suspension points</em> â€” statements in its body that may pause the function execution to be resumed at a later moment in time. </span><span class="sentence">Each call to another suspending function inside the body of a suspending function is a suspension point. </span><span class="sentence">Suspension points are important because at such a point another function may start being executed in the same flow of execution, leading to potential changes in shared state in the middle of a function execution flow.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Normal functions may not call suspending functions directly, meaning they do not have suspension points. </span><span class="sentence">Suspending functions may call normal functions without any limitation, such calls are not suspension points. </span><span class="sentence">The exception for this rule are inlined lambda parameters that, if the inlined higher-order function invoking them is called from a suspending function, may also have suspension points and call other suspending functions.</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Note: suspending functions interleaving each other in this manner is not dissimilar to how functions from different threads interact on platforms that support multithreading. </span><span class="sentence">There are, however, several key differences. </span><span class="sentence">First, suspending functions may pause only at suspension points, this process cannot be paused at arbitrary execution point. </span><span class="sentence">Second, this may happen in one platform thread. </span><span class="sentence">In multithreaded environment, suspension functions may also be interleaved by the usual rules of concurrent execution on this platform, independent of the interleaving of coroutines.</span></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">The implementation of suspending functions on a particular platform is platform-dependent. </span><span class="sentence">Please refer to the platform documentation for details.</span></p>
